# 🎮 Age of War Clone Game

Welcome to the **Age of War Clone** project! This game is a 2D side-scroller inspired by the classic flash game *Age of War*, where two sides (player and enemy) send units to destroy each other's buildings. The player's goal is to spawn units, engage in combat, and destroy the enemy building located on the opposite side of the screen.


now instead of autospawn units, i want to be able to spawn units with money(gold) ,we gain money by killing a ennemy unit, the ennemy gain money by killing our units. We start, me and the ennemy with 1000 gold; a Basic unit cost 50 gold . Killing a unit gave 70 gold. 

Now we need 3 type of unit per age, with 5 age
Units : (  1 1.png et 1 2.png et 1 3.png/ 2 1.png 2 2.png et 2 3.png ... 5 3.png ) 

The stage are the era we are in, we start at stone age ( stage 1 ) .Then medieval age, Then renaissance age, then modern age, then future age. Each age has 3 units.

i set the sprites in AOW>Assets>sprites>

## 🛠️ Features

- **Player and Enemy Buildings**: Each side has a building with 4000 health points. The goal is to reduce the enemy building's health to 0.
- **Units**: Both the player and the enemy can spawn units. The units automatically move towards the opposing building and deal damage when they reach it.
- **Health Bars**: Buildings have dynamic health bars that display current health. As units deal damage, the health bars are updated.
- **Real-Time Combat**: Units from both sides engage in real-time combat on the battlefield.
- **Modular Codebase**: The project is structured to be scalable, allowing easy additions of new units, buildings, and game mechanics.

## 📁 File Breakdown

### `src/main.py`
The main entry point of the game. It initializes Pygame, sets up the game window, and starts the game loop.

### `src/game.py`
Manages the core game logic including unit spawning, movement, and updating game states (e.g., health, combat).

### `src/entities/building.py`
Defines the `Building` class, which represents the player's and enemy's buildings. It handles health, damage, and rendering.

### `src/entities/unit.py`
Defines the `Unit` class, which represents the units that move across the battlefield. Each unit deals damage when it reaches the enemy building.

### `src/utils.py`
This file will contain utility functions for collision detection, health bar drawing, and other reusable game logic.

## 🎯 Roadmap

- **Player Controls**: Add a control panel for the player to select and spawn different types of units.
- **Combat System**: Implement unit-on-unit combat where units can engage and damage each other.
- **Advanced AI**: Improve enemy AI to balance difficulty and challenge the player with different strategies.
- **Unit Upgrades**: Introduce upgrades and age progression for both the player and the enemy, inspired by the *Age of War* mechanics.
