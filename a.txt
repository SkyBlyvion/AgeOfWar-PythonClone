The project is a Python-based 2D strategy game, 
inspired by the original Age of War, where the player 
manages resources and fights against an enemy by spawning units, 
upgrading their base, and advancing through different ages of technology.

Built using the Pygame library, this game replicates the core mechanics 
of the original flash game, while offering flexibility to expand its features.

Game Objective:

    The player's goal is to defend their base and destroy the enemyâ€™s base 
        by strategically deploying units, purchasing turrets, and advancing 
        through five different technological ages.

    As you defeat enemy units, you earn gold, which can be used to 
        spawn more units, buy upgrades, and improve your defenses.

Core Mechanics:
 - Gameplay Structure:

    The game is a side-scrolling strategy where two bases 
        are positioned on opposite sides of the screen: the player's 
        base on the left and the enemy's base on the right.

    The battle takes place between these two bases, with units 
        spawned from both sides moving toward the enemy base to deal damage.
